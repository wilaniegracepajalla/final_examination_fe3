            When two heart beat as one.
            That's when the love will start.
            A love that so true. 
            That will make our heart feel so sure. 
            The pain of one is the pain of the other. 
            And the happiness is also too. 
            When your heart is tired, mine will pump for you. 
            And support the other, that's what partners do. 
            So when you're so down and up in this world. 
            Just remember I'm here for you. 
            Navigate and solve problems together. 
            That's what other half I want to spend my life with.

            When the day comes that your love is gone, 
            I'll be your reminder for what been through,
            for our two world to be as one and to be with you.
            When you find yourself lost in all your what if in love, 
            I'll be your greatest bet that will win your heart and 
            remove the doubt in your precious heart.
            When you push me away again and again, 
            I'll find a thousand or millions of reasons to run back at you and 
            love you more.
            You're one of my happiness and treasure that i will never let go
            without a fight, even if the world turns against me. 
            so please be happy and do what makes you happy, 
            coz seeing you that way makes me more than happy.

            Like the Sun that gives light and new begining to everyone.
            You give me a reason to start a new with full of hope and motivation.
            Like the Moon, that gives the darkest night a touch of beauty and peace.
            You help me see the beauty in pain and sadness, and help me find peace 
            from my troublesome and mischievous thoughts.
